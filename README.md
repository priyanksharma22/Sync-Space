# SyncSpace - Room Booking System

SyncSpace is a backend project for a multi-user room booking application, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  
It provides a complete RESTful API for users to browse and book rooms, and for administrators to manage all system data.

A simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend is included for demonstration and testing purposes.
